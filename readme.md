The premise is you enter ingredients that you currently have in yr kitchen, 
which filters a list of recipes scraped from Jamie Oliver's website. Conceived
and written over the course of cooking and eating one dinner, and therefore
pretty hacked together. I basically just wanted the source to be in the cloud 
for easy access.
